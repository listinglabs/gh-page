Hello!

You did your research and decided to sell some products. These can be handmade jewelry, t-shirts, printable, etc. .

Now you are trying to decide where to start selling your products. Shopify vs Etsy? It is just normal! All of the successful sellers was in this path.

Let's first summarize Shopify and Etsy!

Etsy is a marketplace where you can upload your product at and start selling immediately. Etsy is getting 400 Millions monthly visits and visitors are mostly searching for handmade and creative products. All you need to do is understanding your competitors, outcompete them eventually and get more and more visitors to your products.

On the other hand, Shopify is an e-commerce platform which provides set of tools to create online store on your own.  Design of the online store, accessibility of the store and attracting the customers are completely depends on you as a store owner. 

I think Etsy has a lot of advantages accessing and attracting the customer over Shopify because, buyers are already visiting the Etsy and they are visiting for purchasing product. If you are visible to the buyers, it is almost impossible to not to make a sale!

Lets go through over this comparison in detail with the points below:

1. **Pricing**
2. **Accessing to Customers**
3. **Ease of Use**
4. **FAQ: Shopify vs Etsy** 
5. **Conclusion**
<br/><br/>



## 1. Pricing

### **Shopify Pricing**

There are 3 different pricing plan on Shopify: [Shopify Pricing](https://www.shopify.com/pricing)
<br/><br/>

{% include etsy-vs-shopify-comparison.html %} 
{% endcapture %}
{{ includeGuts | replace: '    ', ''}}
<br/>
I think Basic Shopify plan lets you create your store with every feature required as a starter. I can upload unlimited products and sell without any problem using discount code creation and abandoned cart creation features.

### **Etsy Pricing**

On the other hand, Etsy have almost no upfront cost for starters. Etsy doesn't charge monthly fee like a Shopify on its basic plan. I only pay listing fees and transaction costs at Etsy. [Etsy Pricing](https://www.etsy.com/sell)
<br/><br/>
{% capture includeGuts %}
{% include etsy-vs-shopify-comparison_etsy_pricing.html %} 
{% endcapture %}
{{ includeGuts | replace: '    ', ''}}

<br/>

I think Standard plan is just enough to start making sales. I never felt like I need the features of Plus plan to make more sales. It is only required if you want to apply more polishing to your store.

**Winner: Etsy**

Since it doesn't have any monthly fee for starters, I choose Etsy as a winner of Pricing round

# 2. Accessing to Customers

If there is a selling product on the table (e.g. if your competitors already selling similar products), making a sale is mostly related about the count of the visitors ending up on your store. Average ecommerce conversion rates are [stated](https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization/#understanding-online-store-conversion-rates) as 1% - 2%. There is a simple formula: more visitors I get to my store, more sales I make.

### Getting visitors on Etsy

Etsy is a marketplace platform which gets around [**400 Million visits each month.**](https://www.similarweb.com/website/etsy.com/#overview)

When you open an online store on Etsy, think of it like you are opening a retail store on the street in the heart of the city center where 80 Million people is walking at each month. 

I don't need to have extraordinary effort to reach them, visitors are already there.  I only have to make sure that my products stand out in my Etsy store.

### **Getting visitors on Shopify**

On the other hand, Shopify is not a marketplace. It just give you set of tools to create your own store in the internet. With Shopify, I have to promote my store in the facebook, twitter, pinterest and rank in the Google search results for specific keywords (SEO) related with my products.

I think it is overwhelming to handle all these things to reach my audience when starting out. Since Shopify is not a marketplace, we have to find our candidate customers and direct them to our store.

 

**Winner: Etsy**

Etsy already has 400 Million monthly visitors who visits solely for buying something. Opening an online store in a marketplace like an Etsy is a huge plus.
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
## 3. Ease of Use

The biggest requirement for me was to start selling immediately without involving into so much technical stuff. It is important because I want to spend my time more on how to make more sales instead of learning the technical details of the e-commerce platform.

### Getting Started with Shopify

Shopify is an e-commerce platform which gives you set of features to build your online store. You can select a theme from variety of them, play with colors, upload products, connect your domain, setup your payment processor and all easily. 

![Ease of use Etsy vs Shopify: Shopify Dashboard]({{ "/assets/images/shopify_vs_etsy/shopify_ease_of_use.png" | absolute_url }})

Even it is not so hard to use available features of Shopify, I still need to google some things to get my Shopify store up and running.

I think main screen of Shopify is very clean, easy to use and intuitive.

### Getting Started with Etsy

Etsy is just simple and pretty straightforward to get started. I just create my account, select my store name and it is ready. 

![Ease of use Etsy vs Shopify: Etsy Dashboard]({{ "/assets/images/shopify_vs_etsy/etsy_ease_of_use.png" | absolute_url }})

I can immediately start selling after uploading my products (photos, titles and descriptions). Since I just want to start selling without thinking a lot about how to create my store, Etsy is just my go to platform.
<br/>
 

**No winner. Draw!**

Both Etsy and Shopify is super easy for getting started. I can be an online seller under 60 minutes if I already have something to sell.
